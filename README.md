# Crypto Tracker
A simple cryptocurrency tracker using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API.

## Functioning
Enter cryptocurrency name, click on search and get the price, 24h change and market cap.

## Future Improvements
The Enter button on the keyboard should search. Currently, the search needs to be clicked and enter cannot function.
UI/UX needs to be improved.
